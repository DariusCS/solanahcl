| Component | Validator Requirements | Additional RPC Node Requirements |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **CPU**   | - 2.8GHz base clock speed, or faster<br />- SHA extensions instruction support<br />- AMD Gen 3 or newer<br />- Intel Ice Lake or newer<br />- Higher clock speed is preferable over more cores<br />- AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)<br />- Support for AVX512f is helpful | |
|           | 12 cores / 24 threads, or more | 16 cores / 32 threads, or more |
| **RAM**   | Error Correction Code (ECC) memory is suggested<br />Motherboard with 512GB capacity suggested | |
|           | 256GB or more | 512 GB or more for **all [account indexes](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-an-rpc-node#account-indexing)** |
| **Disk**  | PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better, on each of:<br />- **Accounts**: 500GB, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)<br />- **Ledger**: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested<br />- **Snapshots**: 250GB or larger. High TBW suggested<br />- **OS**: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK<br /><br />The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk<br /><br />Accounts and ledger *can* be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended<br /><br />The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community | Consider a larger ledger disk if longer transaction history is required<br /><br />Accounts and ledger **should not** be stored on the same disk |
| **GPUs**  | Not necessary at this time<br />Operators in the validator community do not use GPUs currently | |

## Recommended Hardware

### CPU

AMD is the CPU maker of choice when it comes to running Solana validators. Intel Xeon Gold/Platinum (6[45]xx) are the only ones known to be able to keep up with the chain.


**NOTE**: This list is not exhaustive, just a selection of CPUs different folks on the discord have run or are currently running. 
- 24 cores is the sweet spot, as of 10/2024, 
- 12/16cores will most likely struggle and,
- more than 32 cores will have a slower base clock speed due to TDP issues (32 cores would possibly be more future proof)

These recommendations also work for RPC nodes, but RPC nodes require more cores and RAM to perform better under load

### Notes

- **CPU Selection:** Prioritize CPUs with higher base clock speeds to meet Solana validator performance requirements. Ensure the selected CPU supports at least AVX2 instructions, with AVX-512 providing additional performance benefits. The AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ PRO and AMD EPYC™ series listed above are optimized for high-performance and multi-threaded tasks essential for validator operations.

- **Storage Selection:** Choose NVMe SSDs that offer high IOPS to handle the intensive read/write operations necessary for validator nodes. Samsung's Pro series and WD's SN850X are highly recommended for their reliability and performance within the validator community.

- **Memory Considerations:** While not part of the table, remember that **RAM** requirements are crucial. Ensure you have ECC memory and sufficient capacity as per the [Hardware Recommendations](#recommended-hardware) section. RAM **speed** and DDR4 vs DDR5 are not known to make any significant differences

## FAQ

Q: My validator doesn't catch up or catches up slowly or does not keep up with the tip

A: If you've followed the [setup instructions](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-a-validator) correctly, make sure to:
  (via [ax on discord](https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/1187805174803210341/1288757805062553600))

  i would like to suggest using the acronym "core" when beginners are asking for help, because its always the same question with same answers. it helps to break down the steps and make the guidance easier to follow:
- c: check cpu performance (focus on single-thread speeds)
- o: optimize nvme by separating ledger and accounts
- r: remove unnecessary cli arguments
- e: enable performance mode 

### setup performance mode

```sudo apt install cpufrequtils```

```sudo bash -c 'echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor'```
